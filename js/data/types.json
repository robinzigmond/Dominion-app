{
	"Action": "Action cards can be played in the Action phase of one's turn. By default, only one can be played in each action phase - although many Action cards give the player additional actions to use. Most Kingdom cards are Actions, and they can have any of a huge variety of different effects.",

	"Treasure": "Treasure cards can be played in the Buy phase of one's turn. Any number of Treasure cards can be played - they are played one after the other, in order. (Usually the order does not matter, but with some Treasure cards it does.) The main purpose of Treasures is to generate coins to spend on buying cards from the Supply - but many Kingdom Treasure cards have additional or other effects.",

	"Victory": "Victory cards are worth Victory Points if they are in your deck at the end of the game - and of course the number of VPs each player has is what determines the winner. But Victory cards cannot be played during your turn (unless they also have another type), meaning that each Victory card gained makes it harder to maintain an effective deck.",

	"Curse": "Only one card - Curse itself - has the curse type. See below for more information.",

	"Attack": "In general, Attack cards are those which have a negative impact on the other players when they are played. But different attacks vary in their effectiveness according to circumstances - a particular attack might be devastating to one strategy, while actively helping a different one.",

	"Reaction": "A Reaction card is one which can be revealed from a player's hand in response to a particular event, in order to trigger a beneficial effect for the player who has it. A common beginner's misconception is that Reaction cards are those which offer protection from Attacks - but while several do (or at least mitigate the harmful effects), others have nothing to do with Attacks at all.",

	"Duration": "Duration cards, unlike other playable cards, are not discarded at the end of the turn on which they are played - they usually stay in play for one or more subsequent turns, and continue to affect the game until discarded. Introduced in the Seaside expansion, Durations were re-used in Adventures and all subsequent expansions.",

	"Prize": "The Prizes are 5 particular cards in Cornucopia which are not in the Supply, and can only be gained through playing the Tournament card with a Province in hand. As their name suggests, they are very powerful - games with Tournament often involve a rush to get the first Prize.",

	"Shelter": "The Shelters are not in the Supply, and can never be gained during the game - they are 3 cards in each player's starting deck, replacing Estates, which are used in some games involving Dark Ages cards. (The probability of using Shelters is equal to the proportion of Dark Ages cards in the Kingdom.) Although weak cards, they offer several benefits over Estates - but some Kingdom cards are weakened by using Shelters instead of Estates.",

	"Ruins": "Ruins are penalty cards, from the Dark Ages expansion - not quite as bad as Curses but generally very undesirable - which are distributed by Looters. They are in the Supply, but only used when there is a Looter in the game. There are 5 different Ruins, which are shuffled together randomly into a Ruins pile of the appropriate size - 10 for each player after the first. The deck is kept face-down, apart from the top card, so that no player knows precisely which Ruins are in the game or what is coming next.",

	"Looter": "The three Looter cards, in the Dark Ages expansion, are simply those which interact with Ruins. Two are Attacks which distribute them to other players, while the third comes with Ruins when gained. Ruins are in the Supply if and only if a Looter is present.",

	"Knight": "The 10 Knight cards, from Dark Ages, form a single Kingdom pile, which is shuffled and kept face-down apart from the top card. The primary use of Knights is as an Attack which trashes other players' cards, a feature which is shared by all of them. But each of the 10 offers a different additional bonus - at times, the decision on whether or not to go for Knights depends on the desirability of the Knight on top of the pile.",

	"Reserve": "Found only in Adventures, most Reserve cards have very weak effects when played, and then go to the player's Tavern mat. Most can then later be \"called\" at a time of the player's choosing, for their main effect. In many ways similar to Duration cards, they allow the player to precisely control the timing of certain effects - but they have the downside of being usually quite slow.",

	"Traveller": "8 cards in Adventures have the Traveller type, two of them being Kingdom cards. Those two are each the base of an ascending chain of 5 cards, where each one can be traded in for the next when discarded from play. The cards at the top of each sequence (which are not travellers) are incredibly powerful, but it can be quite an investment to get to them.",

	"Gathering": "A type found on only 3 cards, all from Empires. All gather VP tokens on their supply pile, which can then be taken by one of the players under certain circumstances.",

	"Castle": "The Castles, found in Empires, form a single Kingdom pile with 8 different cards. All are Victory cards, with a variety of other types and effects, and most interact in some way with the other Castles. (In games with 3+ players 4 are duplicated to make the standard 12-card Victory pile.) They are always ordered from cheapest to most expensive.",

	"Event": "Introduced in Adventures, and continued in Empires, Events offer players the possibility of using their Buy Phase for getting powerful one-time effects, instead of obtaining new cards for their deck. Events do not count towards the total of 10 Kingdom piles, and it is recommended to not use more than 2 in each game.",

	"Landmark": "Introduced in Empires, Landmarks are global conditions, applying to all players, which either offer an additional way to get VP tokens during the game, or give the players additional VPs at the end of the game for certain achievements. Landmarks do not count towards the total of 10 Kingdom piles, and it is recommended to not use more than 2 per game. By affecting the victory conditions, the presence of Landmarks can have a huge effect on the best way to play a given Kingdom.",

	"Night": "Introduced in Nocturne, Night cards can be played in the Night phase of the turn - and only then. Any number can be played. The Night Phase comes after the usual Action and Buy phases (but before Cleanup), and Night cards typically have effects which depend on what the player did in the whole of the preceding turn.",

	"Heirloom": "The Heirlooms are 7 unique cards found in the Nocturne expansion, which can each replace one of the Coppers in the players' starting decks. They are all Treasures, and typically still weak - but offer more interesting effects than Copper. Each is tied to a particular Kingdom card from Nocturne, and is only used - replacing 1 starting Copper - if that card is in the Kingdom.",

	"Fate": "Fate cards are found in the Nocturne expansion - the purpose of this type is to easily show which cards can give out Boons, and therefore that the deck of Boon cards is needed that game.",

	"Doom": "Doom cards serve the same purpose as Fate cards (both types being only found in Nocturne) - whereas Fate cards give out Boons (beneficial effects), Doom cards give out Hexes (negative effects). For this reason, most - but not all - Doom cards are also Attacks.",
	
	"Spirit": "The Spirit type applies to only 3 cards, in the Nocturne expansion. They are all cards which are not in the Supply, and can be gained only be the effects of certain other particular cards. In particular, Exorcist can gain any of the three - and it is only for ease of wording on Exorcist that the Spirit type exists.",

	"Zombie": "There are 3 different Zombie cards in the Nocturne expansion - with only 1 copy of each. They are not Kingdom Cards, and are only used when the Necromancer card is in the Kingdom - in which case each of the 3 Zombies starts the game in the Trash. (Necromancer can use them even when they are in the Trash.)",

	"Boon": "Nocturne includes a deck of 12 Boon cards, signifying various beneficial effects which can be obtained by the players using cards of the Fate type.",

	"Hex": "Like the Boon cards, also from Nocturne, the Hexes are a deck of 12 different cards giving \"small\" effects. Whereas Boons are positive effects, and are given out by Fate cards, Hexes are negative effects, given out by Doom cards.",

	"State": "States are 3 different cards in Nocturne, which give persistent effects (positive or negative) to the players who hold them - until the State is lost. There are 5 different states - 2 of the 3 cards being double-sided.",

	"Artifact": "The Artifacts are 5 cards, found in the Renaissance expansion and each linked to a particular Kingdom card, which do not go in players' decks, but go in front of the player who has them, and provide that player with a \"permanent\" effect as long as they have them. But there is only one copy of each, and whenever you are entitled to take one you take it from the player with it!",

	"Project": "Found in Renaissance, Projects are similar to Events in that they are special effects which players can buy, which are not represented by cards which go in the player's deck. But while events are only used once when bought (although they can be bought again by the same player later), Projects are permanent and last for the rest of the game (and can't be bought again by the same player). As with Events and Landmarks, it is only suggested to use at most 2 per game - but if more are used, players cannot buy more than 2 in any case."
