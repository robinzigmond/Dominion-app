In order to get a high enough density of Minions for this to happen other than by good fortune, heavy {trash}ing is usually necessary. Other {Action} cards, especially if they give +{Buy} and/or are non-terminal, allow one to do more than simply get 8 coins each turn (which won't be enough compensation for the time you spend trashing down), and can allow a Minion deck to be hugely powerful. If these supporting features are not present in the {Kingdom} then Minions can be ignored, but if not then there is frequently a race to see which player can get the most Minions.",

The reason for this is purely what happens when multiple Torturers are played in a turn - a single Torturer attacks like [Militia] but with the option to avoid the discard at the cost of taking a [Curse]. However, unlike Militia, the formulation is \"discard 2 cards\" rather than \"discard down to 3\" - so if Torturer is played twice and you are determined not to take a Curse, you end up with a 1-card hand, with which it is almost always impossible to achieve anything ([Menagerie] is probably the biggest exception here, and even that is no guarantee of being able to have a good turn). So if you can build an {engine} to play multiple Torturers in a turn, the opponent will be forced to take Curses (since the Curses go to hand they mitigate the effect of any subsequent discard), at least until the pile runs out. What makes Torturer so potent is that it is itself a powerful {terminal*draw} card, and therefore only needs to be combined with a {village} - any village - to threaten to bury the opponent in curses (else he discards his whole hand repeatedly). For this reason, games involving Torturer and at least one village are often a knife-edge race - the first player to play 2 or 3 Torturers in a single turn will likely dominate.",

In compensation for this, Lookout has two particular disadvantages. One, which it admittedly shares with several other trashers, is that it is slow: only trashing one card at a time, and taking up a slot in your hand. To compensate for this defect though, the card it trashes doesn't come from your hand (so you maintain at least a 4-card hand if you play it as your first {Action} in a turn), and it is at least {non-terminal}. The more serious disadvantage though is the fact that you must trash one of three cards, which are not known to you when you play it. This makes playing Lookout later in the game something of a gamble. The trashing is unlikely to be relevant (unless opponents are giving you [Curse]s), but the filtering can be very nice - but is it worth the risk of turning over three [Province]s, or another less drastic combination of cards which you do not want to trash? Often the potential benefit isn't worth the risk, which makes Lookout a liability in the late game. On the other hand, most trashers are redundant in the late game, so on balance I would personally say that Lookout is better than it is often given credit for.

Drawing an extra card the following turn is effectively {non-terminal*draw} - that is, playing a Caravan this turn is essentially equivalent to playing a [Laboratory] at the start of your following turn. This is very significant because Caravan costs only 4 coins, 1 coin less than Lab and all the other non-terminal draw cards such as [Hunting Party] (the only other sub-5 coins non-terminal draw cards either are conditional on something else like [Menagerie] or have a significant drawback like [Advisor]). And the difference between 4 coins and 5 coins is much larger than it may seem - it is much easier to afford 4 coins than 5 coins in the early game, and most \"{gain}ers\" such as [Workshop] and [Ironworks] are limited to gaining cards costing at most 4 coins. As a result, Caravan is one of the easiest ways to get consistently large handsizes, and for this reason an extremely popular card whenever it is on the table. Being a cantrip of course makes there virtually no downside to having many in your deck. So Caravan is one of the strongest 4 coins cost cards in the game. Its only real downsides are ones it shares with all {Duration}s - and which make it strictly weaker than Laboratory despite the very similar effect - namely that by delaying its benefit to the following turn it has slightly less chance to have an impact on the game, and that by staying in play for a turn it will miss the reshuffle more often than non-Duration cards.",

This sounds great, and Island itself provides 2vp - the problem is how slow the process is. Unlike any genuine trasher, Island itself is removed from your deck after removing 1 other card - so you can't clear up your own deck to any great extent. Perhaps the best use of Island is in a deck-drawing {engine} where you buy 1 [Province] (or other victory card) and 1 Island each turn, while using the Island you bought last turn to remove last turn's Province from your deck. This allows you to consistently get vps with no change in your deck composition.

Since Pirate Ship is itself a non-Treasure which can give coins, it ends up feeling like a \"must-buy\". But in reality, there is usually a much better way to deal with opposing Pirate Ships - take advantage of the fact that your Copper is being trashed for you, and build an unstoppable {engine} before your opponent's Pirate Ships reach full value.

Put this way, it may not sound like the card is worth 5 coins - but it almost always is, because 1 poor turn and 1 great turn are almost always better than 2 mediocre ones. The exceptions to this are where you have an extremely consistent {engine} which can carry out whatever you need it to each turn - but if you don't, then Tactician can be amazing because those 5 extra cards are 1 extra action are the greatest tool in the game to aid engine consistency, and the extra buy makes up for the fact that you will have partially or entirely \"wasted\" your previous turn. So Tactician is an extremely strong, solid and consistent card which should almost always come in for strong consideration when deciding on cards to buy.

Since Transmute requires a [Potion] in order to {buy}, it is impossible to open with it - so by the time you've got a Transmute, your chances of drawing it with an Estate are not that high, and you could have got Gold quicker just by buying [Silver]s - plus then you wouldn't have a Potion in your deck which is useless for buying [Province]s (or many useful {engine} cards) with. Combine this with the fact that the other cases for Transmute are not too appealing, and it becomes apparent why Transmute is considered an extremely weak card.

And it must never be forgotten that Bishop allows the opponents the option of trashing a card from their hand whenever you play it - this is much more important than it may sound, frequently letting opponents set up a strong {engine} much quicker than they otherwise could. But despite all I have said, Bishop can be a strong VP-generator which also clears your deck of junk.

Since you're almost guaranteed to want some Actions, Quarry might seem pretty handy - but simply wanting to buy a few Actions over the course of the game is not in itself a reason for wanting to bother with Quarry. There is a lot of opportunity cost involved in doing so - both in spending 4 coins and a buy on one, instead of a [Silver] or a directly useful Action card, and in the fact that it turns back into a Copper if you draw it on a turn where you don't want to buy an Action. Indeed, Quarry is best avoided unless you \"know\" you want it, which tends to be in one of 2 situations where cost-reducers always shine - when you expect to have multiple buys (and want to spend them all on Actions), or when you have a way to directly {gain} (Action) cards costing up to a certain amount. Note that the latter use is not so relevant to Quarry, because it cannot be played before the buy phase (unless you also happen to have a [Black Market] or [Storyteller]) so cannot affect cards like [Workshop].

If two piles run out with meaningful time left before the game ends (remember that the game ends as soon as there are 3 empty Supply piles, unless playing with 5+ players), then each City is equivalent to a Village, Laboratory and [Market] all in one card, so you are almost guaranteed to win if you have the majority of them and get the first turn with them fully \"powered up\". So needless to say, Cities are much better when piles are likely to run out - this usually means either one or more piles of cheap {non-terminal} cards in the Kingdom (common examples are [Fishing Village] and [Caravan]), or {Attack}s which give out [Curse]s or {Ruins}. Cities are also usually not worth bothering with unless you actually need the additional {Action}s, because otherwise they do essentially nothing to start with and are no better than Laboratories even when one pile is empty.

Where the two attacks differ considerably is in what phase of the game they are most effective. With Torturer, the game often becomes a rush to get turns where you play 3 or 4 Torturers - the first player to do this usually is very likely to win. Torturer chains are less effective later because the [Curse]s are likely to have run out. Rabble chains, on the other hand, churn through the opponents' decks, discarding any playable cards in the top 3 - so multiple Rabbles are likely to leave 3 useless {Victory} or Curse cards on top of the deck. This naturally is only effective if the opponent actually has Victory cards in the deck - the 3 starting [Estate]s have usually been {trash}ed by the time a Rabble chain can be set up, and even if not they are likely to be too far spread out. But if an opponent is {buy}ing [Province]s or other Victory cards at a steady pace - as in most {money} strategies, including {alt-VP}-based ones - then Rabble chains in the mid or late-game can slow their deck to a virtual standstill. For this reason, the presence of Rabble, more than any other terminal draw card, strongly discourages money strategies and encourages {engine}s - providing the villages are there to support one.",

As far as its on-play effect is concerned, the card is accepted as being \"worth\" 4 coins - since many cards which are Peddler with a small bonus, such as [Market], [Bazaar], and [Highway], cost 5 coins. No player in their right mind would actually spend 8 coins on one, and almost certainly not 6 coins either. The ideal case for Peddlers is in an {Action}-heavy deck with some source of extra {buy}s - because then Peddlers are likely to cost 0 coins, and the extra buys enable one to pick up large quantities of them quickly. And while Peddlers are certainly not amazing, providing 1 coin while replacing themselves in the hand is very valuable for many of these kinds of decks. Almost any {engine} can typically do this - but [Worker's Village] is the best single card for picking up lots of Peddlers, since it provides both the Action and the Buys which are needed. If both players are building engines with extra buys, expect the Peddlers to run out fast! The other interesting feature of Peddler is that its \"official\" cost is 8 coins, even though you would never buy it for that. So it is great fuel for all {trash*for*benefit} cards - feed it to [Salvager] for a \"free\" [Province], or [Apprentice] to draw 8 cards! And any game involving both Peddler and [Swindler] can become very strange - any Swindler play could turn an opponent's Province into a mere Peddler, but if there are no more Peddlers (which as just discussed is very likely as the game goes on), you risk turning one of their Peddlers into a Province!",

A card with the latter effect would probably cost 7 coins, so to have that potential effect on a card costing just 3 coins is incredible, and borderline broken.

Part of the challenge of Menagerie is the hand manipulation sometimes needed to make sure you get the +3 Cards - {Attack}s like [Militia] which make you discard can be a great help, and if left to your own devices then cards which enable you to discard others from your hand for some benefit (including [Hamlet], [Vault], [Storeroom] and others) can be enormously helpful. Without discard effects, duplicate {non-terminal} {Action}s do no harm, but duplicate {Treasure} and {Victory} cards make it impossible for your Menageries to draw more than 1 card.

What Horse Traders effectively does is turn 2 cards in your hand into 3 coins, which in a {money} strategy is not a great improvement in your <Coin density. The exception is when your deck is running at a low money density, usually due to a larger-than-usual number of {Victory} cards. And this is why Horse Traders is one of the best enablers in the game for {alt-VP} strategies, because when going for most alt-VP cards you end up with a lot of those Victory cards in your deck, and further only need 4 coins or 5 coins per turn to keep on buying the Victory cards you need. And even better, the extra Buy can be always be used on [Copper] if there is no better alternative - and Copper is actually a good card for these strategies! So Horse Traders is great with most alt-VP cards - [Duke] being considered a particularly potent combo, because of HT's ability to keep on producing 5 coins even in a hand full of dead cards. Outside of these uses, Horse Traders most often finds use as a fantastic counter to discard {Attack}s, since if you are attacked by [Militia] with a HT in hand then you only need discard one card, then draw a new one to replace it at the start of your next turn.

	 "discussion": "Hunting Part is simply a [Laboratory] with the twist that the second of the 2 cards it draws will always be one that you don't already have in your hand. Although this makes it worse than Laboratory if you have no such cards left in your deck and discard pile, more usually this makes Hunting Party much stronger than Lab - which is very significant when Lab is already among the best 5 coins {Action}s in the game. The most significant reason why skipping any cards you already have in your hand is an advantage is that you usually have only relatively few of your really good cards, and several copies of your weaker cards (notably [Copper]s and [Estate]s) - so if you have one of each in hand, Hunting Party will, after the first \"blind\" draw, be guaranteed to then find something different, and almost certainly better. It is aptly named, being frequently able to \"hunt\" for the cards you need. Play [Village], play the only [Goons] in your hand, then play Hunting Party to try to find one of your other copies of Goons - and this works of course with any strong {terminal} in place of Goons. Note that Hunting Party requires no {trash}ing to achieve things like this - while Laboratory will struggle with it even if you are able to trash down heavily with cards like [Chapel]. Indeed, while Laboratory, great though it is, is only ever a helper to draw big hands and therefore find your other strong cards and combos, Hunting Party makes a deck type almost by itself. If you just {buy} one or more [Silver]s, a single [Gold], a single {terminal*Silver}, and then a bunch of Hunting Parties, it is easy to use the HPs to pull together 8 coins to buy a [Province] in every single hand (from Copper, Silver, Gold and the terminal Silver). And note that, although it may be slowed down a little by the first Province, this deck almost doesn't care about any subsequent Provinces. About the only big weakness of this deck type is that it doesn't handle [Duchy] well, and therefore can find it hard to come back if it falls behind. It also is devasated by {Ruins} - much more so than by [Curse]s - and is much weakened if {Shelter}s replace Estates in the starting deck.",

	 "imagePath": "images/card_images/Jester.jpg",
	 "discussion": "Jester is not usually terribly effective as an {Attack} - but it is very swingy and can lead to some really fun turns, and indeed games. Its most effective use is probably to hand [Curse]s to the opponents if they have many {Victory} cards in their decks - usually because they are pursuing an {alt-VP} strategy, or sometimes if they are making heavy use of hybrid Victory cards such as [Nobles]. Although even in this case it is much less reliable than say [Witch] in giving out Curses - it mainly serves to discourage getting too many Victory cards too early when it is present. The potential to {gain} copies of your opponents' good cards - in the best case, this could be something really strong and expensive like [King's Court] or even [Possession] - particularly because in so doing you make them discard the card and therefore not use it until they have reshuffled, is very attractive. And so is giving them more copies of their weak cards (hitting Victory cards to give them Curses can reap great rewards if your future Jesters hit those Curses). So Jester is by no means a weak card. Its main problem is that you have almost no way of controlling which effect you will get. And if you hit a card which is important to your opponent's strategy but harmful to your own (say you are playing an {engine} with no {Treasure}s, while they are playing a {money} deck, and you hit [Silver]) then you will not be pleased with either of the options you have. This situation is actually quite common if you are pursuing a different strategy from that opponent.",

	 "discussion": "One of the flagship cards for {Cornucopia}'s theme of variety. Since the vast majority of decks will contain 10 or more differently-named cards by the end of the game, Fairgrounds will usually be worth 4vp for 6 coins, which is a pretty fair deal in the endgame (1vp more than [Duchy], for 1 coin more). To make Fairgrounds worth pursuing as an end in itself you want them to be worth 6vp - that's the same as a [Province], but for 2 coins less. An absolutely great deal - but of course it is usually very tricky to get up to 15 different cards and still have a deck which can consistently {gain} even a 6 coins card. The typical game has only 17 differently-named cards available (the 10 {Kingdom} cards, 3 basic {Treasure} and 3 basic {Victory} cards, plus [Curse]), so to get maximum value from Fairgrounds you must choose only 2 to ignore, and obtain at least one copy of each of the others before the game ends. (And of course usually Curse will be one of the cards you don't get, unless of course you've been forced to gain one anyway.) Fairgrounds becomes much more viable as the variety of different cards in the game increases. There are actually a number of ways this can happen: [Young Witch] adds an 11th Kingdom cards, [Potion] adds another {Supply} card, and there are a variety of different non-Supply cards which can be available. The latter includes [Spoils], [Mercenary] and [Madman], but the {Prize}s are great here because there are 5 different ones (although there is only one copy of each, and it's hard to imagine any one player getting all of them). {Ruins} are also great for adding variety, even though they are usually otherwise undesirable - as are having {Shelter}s in the starting deck, or getting several different {Knight}s (and having them survive until the end of the game, which is always tricky with Knights). With enough of these in the game, it is at least theoretically possible for Fairgrounds to be worth 8 or even 10vp! And I'll save the best combo for last: [Black Market]. With a sufficiently large Black Market deck the number of differently-named cards available is for all practical purposes unlimited - but you still have to manage the tricky task of building a deck from so many different components that somehow still can consistently gain Fairgrounds.",
