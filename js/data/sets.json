	"Guilds": "The eighth expansion, released in 2013. A \"small\" expansion, later packaged together with Cornucopia.

	"Nocturne": "The eleventh expansion, released in 2017. Themed around the supernatural, it introduces new gameplay elements including an additional Night Phase in each player's turn, 7 unique new starting cards (Heirlooms) which can replace Coppers in the players' starting decks, and Boon, Hex and State cards to give players a variety of different short-term effects, whether good or bad.",

	"Renaissance": "The twelfth and most recent expansion, released in 2018. It introduces a variety of different tokens which can be cashed in on later turns, and cards which stay in front of players (never entering their decks) which give temporary or permanent effects.",

	"Promo": "Promotional cards have been released occasionally, for a variety of different reasons or occasions. They are usually available to buy via the store at boardgamegeek.com. Promos have no common theme - many are \"exotic\" or unusual, while others are relatively straightforward although not felt to be worth including in one of the regular sets."
